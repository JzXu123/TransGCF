# TransGCF
This is the official implementation of the paper: TransGCF: Frequency-Suppressed Reconstruction for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection.
TransGCF introduces a frequency-suppressed reconstruction framework that integrates Local Transformer, Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and a High-Frequency Elimination Block (HFEB) to enhance the detection of anomalies in hyperspectral imagery by improving background reconstruction and amplifying residual contrast.
